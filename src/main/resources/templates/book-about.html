                            on Indian Island by a host who, surprisingly, fails to appear. On the island they are cut off
                            from everything but each other and the inescapable shadows of their own past lives. One by one,
                            the guests share the darkest secrets of their wicked pasts. And one by one, they dieâ€¦ Which
                            among them is the killer and will any of them survive?
